# Task 3 - Collection Framework

It is expected that a string with the same character sequence may be passed several times to the method.
Since the counting operation can be time-consuming, the method should cache the results, so that when the method is given a string previously encountered, it will simply retrieve the stored result.
Use collections and maps where appropriate.
Write tests using phpunit.
